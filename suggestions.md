Interactive Stock Charts: Add interactive price charts with basic technical indicators to give users visual context for the analysis.

Performance Tracking: Implement a system to track the performance of recommendations over time to build user trust.

Backtesting Lite: Add a simple backtesting feature to let users see how the current settings would have performed historically.

Analyst Performance Metrics: Show how accurate each analyst has been historically to help users make better selections.

Customizable Watchlists: Allow users to create and save lists of stocks they're interested in for quick analysis.
